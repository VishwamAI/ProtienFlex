           self.graph_attention = GraphAttentionLayer()
           # Add structure-aware generation
           self.structure_generator = StructureAwareGenerator()
           # Enhanced concept bottleneck
           self.concept_bottleneck = EnhancedConceptBottleneck()
   ```

2. Training Pipeline Updates:
   ```python
   class OptimizedTrainer:
       def __init__(self):
           self.batch_size = self._compute_optimal_batch_size()
           self.gradient_accumulation_steps = 4

       def train_step(self):
           # Implement compute-optimal training
           with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
               loss = self.model(batch)
